This plugin adds an minimal, license free human drone, available from the get-go. No missions or strings attached! All credit to @Loyse for ship design.

The drone can be found in most human shipyards, particularly Betelgeuse, Southbound and Syndicate ones

To make it actually usable in human fleets, freighter that can carry two of them has also been added!
