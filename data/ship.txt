	description "The Korunak Robotics Commercial Drone model series is almost as old as space exploration itself. the first models of this drone were used as surveillance cameras on earth, and later as reconnaissance drones as first colonies were established. They were repurposed as expendable freighter defense vessels during alpha wars, and the main design hasn't changed much since. Since it no longer bears any trademark value, the model 273 is made mostly out of sparingly used aluminium and iron, which gives it poor hull integrity for the sake of affordability and agility"
